# Software Developer

### Introduction
I am a .NET software developer with a background in C# and
web development using the .NET. I Currently work in ERP 
development in the FinTech sector, specializing in Microsoft
Dynamics 365 Business Central.

My ability to adapt to new challenges is demonstrated in my transition
to AL development, after primarily having a C#-focused background.
I initially pursued FinTech and Business Central out of curiosity,
drawn by the opportunity to work with Microsoft technologies.
However, after over a year in this space, I’ve realized that my true
passion lies in back-end development and software architecture with C#.

To reinforce my expertise in modern .NET technologies, I recently built 
a project showcasing my C# and ASP.NET Core skills using .NET 8 
(the latest LTS version). You can find the link to that repo 
in the projects section.
