# Software Developer

### Introduction
I am a passionate software developer with a background of web 
development in C# using the .NET framework. I am currently in ERP 
development using business central. I am quick to adapt to different 
programming languages. This is demonstrated by my ability to adapt to 
the AL programming language after a strict background of developing 
web applications using primarily C#. 
  
I am committed to constantly improving my skills and staying up-to-date 
with the latest industry trends and technologies. I love being involved in 
projects that challenge the way I think and take me out of my comfort 
zone.
